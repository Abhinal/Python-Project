A. Round Brackets are creating tuple here and del function removing all data of tuple.
B. While adding two tuples, we will get new tuple having both tuple's elements.
C. While multiplying by any integer(n) to tuple it will give n times of that tuple in one new tuple.
D. Slicing is working in tuple also.
E. We can typecast the tuple values to list values.
F. Here we can use max, min and len function to see maximum value, 
    minimum value and length of the stored data in given tuple.

1. Reverse Function is use to reversing the elements stored in given variable 
    but before printing we have to create any suitable datatype to store reversed data.
2. Here (10,20) is one of the element of list 'num' and isinstance function is checking 
    whether the element in list is tuple or not. If element is tuple it will break the loop and return the 
    value of ctr which is just equal to the index of first tuple.
3. Here tuple.index function is use to search the element in tuple. It parameters is ("key", first_index, last_index).
4. Slicing is working properly in tuple datatype.
