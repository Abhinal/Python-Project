1. Why lists are called mutable?

Mutable means which can be changed, so list in Python are mutable as you can append, delete, pop 
or do any operation on lists. Using the indexing operator (square brackets) on the left side of an 
assignment, we can update one of the list items.

2. What are the advantages of using list compared to array in C?

Advantages of list compared to array in C are:
> We can store different data types in list but not in array in C 
> Array in C, need to be defined size of the array before adding any elements but in Python
    list does not require any fixed memory size.
> List can be extended and shortened but Array in C is fixed it neither be shortened nor extended.
